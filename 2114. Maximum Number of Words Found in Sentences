        ## Method 1: Concise Method Using max() with a Generator
        # This method calculates the word count for each sentence by counting spaces and adding 1,
        # then uses the max() function to find the sentence with the most words.
        return max(i.count(' ') + 1 for i in sentences)
        
        ## Method 2: Using a Loop and max() to Track the Maximum
        # This method iterates through each sentence, calculates the word count,
        # and updates the variable 'large' to always hold the maximum number of words found so far.
        # large = 0
        # for i in sentences:
        #     large = max(large, i.count(' ') + 1)
        # return large

        ## Method 3: Using a Loop with an if Statement to Track the Maximum
        # This method also iterates through each sentence, calculates the word count,
        # and checks if the current word count is larger than the previously recorded maximum ('large').
        # If it is, 'large' is updated to this new value.
        # large = 0
        # for i in sentences:
        #     current = (i.count(' ') + 1)
        #     if current > large:
        #         large = current
        # return large
